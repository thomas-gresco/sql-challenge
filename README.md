# sql-challenge
## Summary 
Itâ€™s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
## Data Modeling
An Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables is shown in the "sql_challenge_ERD" file.
## Data Engineering and Analysis
In the "employees_db" SQL file tables were created to store the data from the csv files. These tables are represented in the ERD. The data from the given csv files were imported in to these tables.
In the "data_analysis" SQL file, I answer 8 questions about the data.
